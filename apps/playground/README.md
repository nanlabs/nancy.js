<h1>Storybook Playground</h1>

</div>

This app is created with the goals to have examples of ours React components, hooks and libraries that are created in different packages in this repository. To create the examples, in this app we are using storybook stories.

## Requirements

**You’ll need to have Node 16.13.2 or later on your local development machine** (but it’s not required on the server). You can use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nanlabs/nancy.js
cd nancy.js
fnm use
npm install
```

## Quickstart

The ideal way to run this app is from the root of the repo by executing the following command.

```bash
npm run storybook -w @nanlabs/playground
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Pull requests are welcome.

If you have a more representative example of some of the components, hooks, helpers, feel free to create a new story and create a pull request.

Read the [CONTRIBUTING guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn about our development process, how to propose bugfixes and improvements, and how to build and test your changes to React.
